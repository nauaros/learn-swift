//: Write a method on `Student` that returns the studentâ€™s Grade Point Average, or "GPA". A GPA is defined as the number of points earned divided by the number of credits taken. For the example above Jane earned (9 + 16 = **25**) points while taking (3 + 4 = **7**) credits, making her GPA (25 / 7 = **3.57**).
